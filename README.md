Whatâ€™s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?
- In Lab 4, the website is rendered by opening the specific html files, whereas Lab 6 uses a local host to render the content. In Lab 4, since the only file is the All-Articles html page, none of the other pages work and will lead to an error saying "your file could not be accessed". In Lab 6, there was no errors because it renders content by fetching from a server.
